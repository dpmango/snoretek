                    <div class="faq__item__answer">
                      <p>Scientific studies validate the concept</p>
                      <p>The QNZ mouthpiece concept has been validated with numerous medical and scientific studies. The AASM & ADSM recommend a snoring mouthpiece as the first treatment option to treat simple snoring and mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea. Please read this article for more information: http://mouthguardstore.com/articles/medical-experts-recommend-the-snoring-mouthpiece-for-sleep-apnea-and-snoring </p>
                      <p>Although it has been scientifically proven to help treat snoring and sleep apnea, it may not work for 100% of the people. Our satisfaction rate with the product is better than 90%.       </p>

                    <div class="faq__item__title">How does the QNZ work?</div>
                    <div class="faq__item__answer">
                      <p>The QNZ holds your jaw forward during sleep to open the airway and stop snoring.</p>
                      <p>The most common cause of snoring is air being passed through a partially constricted airway causing vibration of the palate during breathing. The QNZ mouthpiece works by moving the jaw forward, which opens up the airway and stretches the palate so it does not vibrate (or vibrates less). </p>

                  <div class="faq__item">
                    <div class="faq__item__title">Is there a simple test to try before I buy the QNZ?</div>
                    <div class="faq__item__answer">
                      <p><b>Yes. You can</b></p>
                      <p>try this. Close your mouth with your teeth together. Then try to make a snoring sound. </p>
                      <p>Then open your mouth a little and move your jaw forward a little at a time and try to make the snoring stop. You will see that the snoring stops or improves. This opening and jaw forward movement is how the mouthpiece stops your snoring.</p>
                      <p>The mouthpiece holds the jaw in that location while you sleep.</p>

                    <div class="faq__item__answer">
                      <p><b>The first night</b></p>
                      <p>For most people you will know the first night, if your snoring stops. If it stops your snoring for even a short while, then you know that moving your jaw forward and holding it there will work for you. Purchasing the QNZ is an economical option to determine if a snoring mouthpiece can help stop your snoring.</p>
                      <p>Following the good sleep hygiene tips http://mouthguardstore.com/articles/how-to-stop-snoring-remedies found in the article section at the mouthguardstore.com website will assure you the best chance to stop snoring.</p>
                      <p>If you do not see improvement right away, try tweaking the QNZ with the steps described below.</p>

                    <div class="faq__item__answer">
                      <p>Six months to two years.</p>
                      <p>There are many factors that can affect the life expectancy of your QNZ. Grinding your teeth while you sleep, how clean you keep it and how you store it will all play a part.</p>
                      <p>Some people regularly purchase every six months and others who come back once every two years.</p>

                    <div class="faq__item__title">The QNZ works but can I get a better mouthpiece?</div>
                    <div class="faq__item__answer">
                      <p><b>Yes.</b></p>
                      <p>It is important to confirm that a snoring mouthpiece can help treat your snoring. The QNZ is a very good first treatment option due to its modest cost and easy fitting process.</p>
                      <p>While many clients replace their QNZ with another one as they periodically wear, others upgrade to a thinner, better fitting and more durable laboratory custom fit appliance called the QuietNite Z Elite. These are available at the mouthguardstore.com website.</p>

                    <div class="faq__item__answer">
                      <p><b>Yes.</b></p>
                      <p>The QNZ has been engineered with large breathing holes to allow you to breathe easily.</p>
                      <p>It is normal for one side of the nose to be temporarily blocked when you first lie down so the breathing holes are helpful. Most people you will revert to nasal breathing within 15 minutes.</p>

                      <p>Most people can see an improvement in their snoring by tweaking the QNZ mouthpiece. Try these steps first to get improvement before returning the mouthpiece.</p>
                      <p>People are understandably disappointed if they find their QNZ does not work right away, but are then pleasantly surprised to find that with a bit of “tweaking” they stop snoring</p>
